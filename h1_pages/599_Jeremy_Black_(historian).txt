Black is the author of over 180 books, principally but not exclusively on 18th-century British politics and international relations, and was described in 2004 as "the most prolific historical scholar of our age". He has published on military and political history, including Warfare in the Western World, 1882–1975 (2001) and The World in the Twentieth Century (2002).

Black studied at Queens' College Cambridge, St John's College Oxford, and Merton College Oxford before joining Durham University as a lecturer in 1980, where he earned his PhD and subsequently a professorship in 1994. His doctoral thesis was entitled British Foreign Policy 1727–1731, and completed in 1983. As a staff candidate he was not attached to any of the Durham colleges.

He was editor of Archives, journal of the British Records Association, from 1989 to 2005.
