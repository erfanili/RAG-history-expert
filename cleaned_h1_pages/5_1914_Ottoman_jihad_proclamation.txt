On 11 November 1914, Ottoman Sultan Mehmed V proclaimed holy war against the Entente powers and appealed for support from Muslims in Entente-controlled countries. The declaration, which called for Muslims to support the Ottomans in Entente-controlled areas and for jihad against "all enemies of the Ottoman Empire, except the Central Powers", was initially presented on 11 November and published in Takvim-i Vekayi the following day. The proclamation included five fatwa or legal opinions endorsed by 29 religious authorities. Several days later, on 14 November, it was read out to large crowd outside the Fatih Mosque by Ali Haydar Efendi, the fetva emini ('custodian of the fatwa', the Ottoman official in charge of dictating tafsir on behalf of the Shaykh al-Islam).

The declaration was seen as mostly ineffective in the war, with the Emirate of Afghanistan avoiding confrontation with the Entente despite pressure from the German and Ottoman Empires and a British-backed revolt taking place against the Ottomans in the Hejaz.
