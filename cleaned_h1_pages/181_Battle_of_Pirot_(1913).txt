On the front between the Bulgarian 3rd Army (Slivnica-Trn-Caribrod) and Serbian 2nd Army (Sofia-Pirot-Nis), the main fighting took place outside Pirot on 6 and 7 July. A commander of the Serbian 2nd Army, general Stepa Stepanovic suggested on 8 July that Pirot was to be evacuated. However, when the Romanian advance threatened the Bulgarian 1st Army on the evening the same day, the Bulgarian command ordered for withdrawal. Due to the Serbian victory at Bregalnica, the Bulgarians were forced to give up aspirations in southeastern Serbia.
