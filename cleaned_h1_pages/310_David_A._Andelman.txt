David A. Andelman (born 1944) is an American journalist, political commentator, and author.

David A. Andelman is the son of Selma (nee Nathanson) and Saul Andelman. He is a graduate of Harvard College and of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.

The New York Times reported that, while Andelman was the newspaper's Yugoslavia correspondent in 1979, "heightened alertness" scuttled an attempt by the KGB to put another Times journalist in a compromising position: "... a Russian man walked past a Soviet guard and into the Moscow bureau of The New York Times, saying he had a package for this correspondent" from Andelman.

Andelman was the editor of World Policy Journal from 2008 to 2015. Following The New York Times, he served for seven years as Paris correspondent for CBS News. He has also worked in editorial roles at Forbes, Bloomberg News, CNBC, and The New York Daily News. From 2010 to 2012, he served as president of the Overseas Press Club.

Andelman was awarded the 2019 Deadline Club Award for Commentary for his CNN and Reuters columns. In 2021, France president Emmanuel Macron named Andelman a chevalier of the Legion of Honor for his work as a journalist and "for his lifelong commitment to promoting better understanding between French and American citizens."

He is the author of a Substack publication entitled, Andelman Unleashed.
