Compiegne (French pronunciation: i; Picard: Compiene) is a commune in the Oise department of northern France. It is located on the river Oise, and its inhabitants are called Compiegnois ( ).

Compiegne is the central commune of an urban unit with 70,699 inhabitants, and a larger commuter zone with 141,504 inhabitants as of 2017. The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Compiegne proper.

The Hotel de Ville (town hall) was completed in 1530.

The Glade of the Armistice in the Compiegne Forest was the site of the signing of two armistices; those of 11 November 1918 and 22 June 1940. Hitler specifically chose the location of the second, and had the original signing carriage moved from Paris to Compiegne, as an irony for the defeated French.

The site still houses several memorials to the 1918 armistice, including a copy of the original railway carriage. The original, Marshal Foch's Carriage was taken to Germany as a trophy of victory following the second armistice. Various rumors about what happened to this railway-carriage thereafter, have flourished ever since. Some believe it was destroyed by the SS in Thuringia in April 1945; others say this happened in Berlin, but most likely was it destroyed during an allied air-raid on Berlin. The latter version seems most plausible, since Ferdinand Foch's carriage actually was displayed at a Berlin museum.

Compiegne is home to the University of Technology of Compiegne (UTC), one of the top ranking engineering school in France, founded as a Technology University in 1972 to provide an alternative to the traditional "grandes ecoles" for students interested in technologies and applied science.

Compiegne station offers connections with Paris, Amiens, Cambrai and several regional destinations. The nearest motorway is the A1 Paris-Lille.

Since 1977, Compiegne is the traditional start city of the famous ParisRoubaix bicycle race. It was also the finish city of 3rd stage in the 2007 Tour de France.
