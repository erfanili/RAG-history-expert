The Battle of Sarikamish was an engagement between the Russian and Ottoman Empires during World War I. It took place from 22 December 1914, to 17 January 1915, as part of the Caucasus campaign.

The battle resulted in a decisive Russian victory. The Ottoman plan relied on highly mobile troops capable of reaching specific objectives at precise times, drawing on German and Napoleonic tactical principles. However, the Ottoman forces were inadequately equipped for the harsh winter conditions and suffered severe losses in the Allahuekber Mountains. It is estimated that approximately 25,000 Ottoman soldiers froze to death before the main engagement began.

Following the defeat, Ottoman Minister of War Enver Pasha, who had devised the strategy at Sarikamish, blamed the Armenians for the outcome. The battle subsequently became a prelude to the Armenian genocide.

Some sources regard the battle as one of the most significant of the campaign, noting that the Ottoman Third Army was so severely weakened that it was forced to suspend operations temporarily.

Russia regarded the Caucasus Front as secondary to the Eastern Front, which received the majority of Russian resources. Russia had captured the fortress of Kars from the Ottoman Empire during the Russo-Turkish War in 1877, subsequently incorporating it into the militarily administered Kars Oblast. After the Ottoman Empire entered World War I in October 1914 on the side of the Central Powers, Russia feared a Caucasus campaign aimed at retaking Kars and the port of Batum.

From the perspective of the Central Powers, a campaign in the Caucasus would serve to divert Russian forces. The immediate strategic objective of the Ottoman Caucasus campaign was to recapture Artvin, Ardahan, Kars, and Batum. In the longer term, the Ottoman Minister of War, Ismail Enver, hoped that a successful offensive would open a route to Tbilisi and beyond, potentially provoking a revolt among Muslims in the Caucasus. Another strategic goal was to cut Russian access to hydrocarbon resources around the Caspian Sea.

The headquarters of the Ottoman Third Army was located in Erzurum, under the command of Hasan Izzet Pasha. On 30 October 1914, the Third Army headquarters was informed by the High Command in Constantinople about the Ottoman Navy's bombardment of the Russian ports of Novorossiysk, Odessa, and Sevastopol in the Black Sea. The High Command expected the Russian Army to cross the Ottoman border at any time. The Bergmann Offensive (2 November 1914 16 November 1914) ended with the defeat of Russian forces under General Bergmann.

After a partial victory in the Bergmann Offensive, the Ottomans reinforced their Caucasian Third Army (50,000 soldiers) with the Tenth Corps (40,000 fresh troops). They correctly assessed that the Russian Caucasian Army did not receive significant reinforcements, apart from the Plastun brigades (11 battalions) and the 2nd Turkestan Corps (21 infantry battalions of 700 soldiers each, and 12 cavalry squadrons of 130 cavalry each). Before planning the Sarikamish Offensive, the chief of staff of the Ninth Corps, Serif Ilden, estimated the Russian strength at 60,000 soldiers, in line with the figure of 64,000 provided by Paul Muratoff.

The Ninth and Tenth Corps of the Ottoman Third Army consisted of well-trained soldiers; however, the army was poorly equipped for winter conditions. Ottoman sources record extremely high casualties from frostbite, though specific figures are not given. A significant portion of the 50,00060,000 non-combat losses suffered by the Ottomans was due to frostbite and a typhus epidemic. In comparison, the Russians lost approximately 6,000 soldiers to frostbite and a further 12,000 to typhus, combat wounds, and other illnesses. Another factor contributing to the high Ottoman non-combat losses was inadequate logistics, rear services, and sanitary measures.

The Ottoman Minister of War, Ismail Enver Pasha, devised an operational plan while at the Department of War in Istanbul. His strategy was based on German principles derived from Napoleonic tactics. The plan involved a single envelopment maneuver using three corps. On the flank, the XI Corps was to fix Russian forces in place and conduct diversionary attacks. On the left, the X Corps (40,000 soldiers) under Colonel Hafz Hakk and the IX Corps (28,000 soldiers) under Brigadier Ali Ihsan Pasha would advance toward Kotek (30 km southwest of Sarikamish), 15 km northeast of the main Russian Army (estimated at 50,000 soldiers), and drive the Russians into the Aras Valley, where they would be destroyed by a coordinated attack from all three corps.

Initially, Hasan Izzet Pasha supported the outflanking maneuver and offensive, influenced by his trust in Enver Pasha. He finalized the details of the plan. On 17 December, Enver Pasha returned to Erzurum after inspecting the army and finding that Hasan Izzet Pasha had accepted the plan. In the presence of other officers, Enver Pasha told Hasan Izzet Pasha: "I am going to Erzurum. Either I will return to Istanbul from there, or I will watch your actions as a spectator."

However, on 18 December, Hasan Izzet Pasha telegraphed Enver Pasha:

IX Corps, X Corps' pioneers would arrive on the Kotek-Kars road in eight to nine days, meanwhile it is doubtful that the XI Corps, left alone, would not be crushed. When the pioneers come out of the great mountains, they will be in a difficult position against the enemy, who are not less than themselves. I see the outcome of this offensive field battle as doubtful according to our preparation. In case of failure, the long expedition will turn against us. Let's not give a pitched battle and be content with expelling the enemy in Id (Narman). For the future, hope is left for attack and invasion...

There is no record of Enver Pasha's immediate response to this message. Later on 18 December, Hasan Izzet Pasha telegraphed again:

I ask for forgiveness from my duty as I do not see the strength and confidence in myself to carry out these movements, and I am actually disturbed by an extraordinary nervousness.

Enver Pasha returned to Koprukoy in an attempt to persuade Hasan Izzet Pasha. When he failed to do so, Enver Pasha temporarily assumed direct command of the Third Army. His chief of staff, Bronsart von Schellendorf, and the head of the operations department, Major Otto von Feldmann (Turkish: Harekat Subesi Muduru), continued to serve under his leadership.

The war zone stretched approximately 1,2501,500 kilometers (780930 miles) from the Black Sea to Lake Van, making concentration of forces challenging. Operations were conducted on a plateau averaging 1,5002,000 meters (4,9006,600 ft) above sea level. The primary difficulty for the Ottomans was the poor state of the roads and inadequate transportation infrastructure. In contrast, Russia's main advantage was the Kars Gyumri Akhalkalaki railway line with a terminal at Sarikamish, located just 24 kilometres (15 mi) from the border.

The only viable routes through the Caucasian heights were high mountain passes near the cities of Kars and Sarikamish. Beyond these lay the upper valleys of the Aras and Euphrates rivers, extending westward. Elsewhere, roads were merely tracks, impassable to artillery. Forces were concentrated about 80 kilometres (50 mi) on either side of the border, with Kars serving as the main Russian fortress and Erzurum as the Ottoman counterpart.

The Ottoman Third Army, under Enver Pasha, comprised the IX, X, and XI Corps. A detachment (one infantry regiment and Special Organization (Teskilat- Mahsusa) volunteers) known as Stanke Bey Mufrezesi, commanded by German Lieutenant Colonel Stange, was sent to Artvin to reinforce the offensive and pin down Russian forces. The total fighting power included 90,000 regular troops, with the Russian Sarikamish detachment consisting of 60,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry (Cossacks), and 14,000 reserves, totalling approximately 78,000 soldiers. Including reserves and personnel from the Erzurum Fortress, total Ottoman manpower reached 118,000, while overall numbers, including transportation units, depot regiments, and military police, reached about 200,000. The Ottomans had 73 machine guns and 218 artillery pieces, a figure comparable to the Russian artillery strength. )

Ottoman forces were inadequately prepared for winter conditions. The IX and X Corps began their long march without winter clothing and carried only dry bread and olives as rations. The XI Corps, positioned at the front, was in a similar situation.

On the Russian side, the 2nd and 3rd Caucasian Corps and the 1st Turkestan Corps had been sent to the Western Front, leaving the following composition in the Caucasus:

At the start of the war, the Russian forces included 100 infantry battalions (about 100,000 infantry), 117 cavalry companies (approximately 15,000 cavalry), and 256 artillery pieces:

The garrison at Kars included the 263rd Infantry Regiment (of the 66th Division), with 4 battalions.

During the Battle of Sarikamish, the Russian Caucasian Army was reinforced by Armenian and Georgian volunteers, as well as the newly formed 3rd Caucasian Rifle Brigade (8 battalions), bringing its total strength to around 130,000 soldiers. During the earlier Bergmann Offensive, the Russian Army had suffered approximately 7,000 casualties.

In the Sarikamish campaign, the Russian Army fighting the Ottoman Third Army consisted of 30 battalions of the 1st Caucasian Corps, 21 battalions of the 2nd Turkestan Corps, and 11 Plastun battalions, totaling 58,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry. Additionally, there were 4 battalions of the 66th Division in Kars, the 3rd Caucasian Rifle Brigade (8 battalions), and the Siberian Cossack Brigade (12 sotni) in Tbilisi, totaling an additional 14,000 soldiers brought as reinforcements.

Apart from these, there were 12 Russian battalions in Batumi and surrounding areas, 8 battalions and 30 cavalry companies in Agr, and 8 battalions and 24 cavalry companies in Iranian Azerbaijan; these units did not participate in the Battle of Sarikamish.

In contrast, the Ottomans committed almost all available forces90,000 soldiers and 218 gunsin an attempt to achieve a decisive victory. A key Russian advantage was that their troops were fully equipped with winter clothing and supported by a well-organized medical system. On the Ottoman side, from the start of the war, approximately 500 soldiers died daily in hospitals. The total number of hospital deaths exceeded 10,000, with additional significant losses from frostbite and typhus occurring outside medical facilities. Many Ottoman soldiers avoided hospitals, believing they had a better chance of survival in the field.

On the far left flank, Hafz Hakks X Corps, comprising 40,000 fresh troops, attacked General Istomins brigade (8,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry) on 22 December. The Ottoman 30th and 32nd Divisions advanced on Kalebogaz, west of Oltu, while the 31st Division moved towards Id (now Narman). Following rearguard actions, the Russians cautiously retreated, and Istomin's brigade withdrew around Oltu. The 31st Division spent the night in Narman, located 15 kilometres south of Oltu.

On 23 December, the 31st Division captured 750 soldiers, including Colonel Kutatedza, and seized two guns. The 31st Division advanced on Oltu from the south, while the 30th and 32nd Divisions approached from the west. Due to a misidentification, the 32nd Division mistakenly opened heavy artillery and rifle fire on the 31st Division, believing them to be Russian troops. The accidental engagement lasted for two hours, after which General Istomin managed to withdraw with minimal losses.

Serif Ilden, citing information from a friend who participated in the battle, claimed that the Ottomans suffered around 2,000 casualties during this incident. However, historian Fahri Belen reported that after consulting multiple officers who were present, the highest estimate of Ottoman losses was 250.

In the following days, X Corps captured 250 Russian soldiers, four guns, and four machine guns. By midday on 23 December, Istomin had evacuated Oltu. Hafz Hakk allowed his troops to pillage the town to boost morale, but as a result, provisions that could have sustained the Ottoman army for several days were lost.

Subsequently, Hafz Hakk redirected X Corps towards the SarikamishKars line instead of the initially planned KarsKotek line. This change extended the distance between X Corps and the 30th and 31st Divisions by approximately 40 kilometres.

On 23 December, the Russian 39th Division launched an attack against the Ottoman XI Corps and captured a significant number of prisoners.

Between 22 and 24 December, IX Corps advanced from Toygarl village to Bardz village. Unlike X Corps, IX Corps did not engage in major combat, aside from dispersing Russian patrols. On the night of 24 December, the 29th Division occupied Bardz after its Russian front guards withdrew. Because the Russians had not destroyed the supplies in time, Bardz contained provisions sufficient to feed the corps for several days. Enver Pasha stationed guards at the supply depots to prevent looting, avoiding the mistakes made at Oltu.

Nevertheless, on the same day, 40% of the 17th Division's troops became stragglers due to a severe snowstorm.

On 24 December, General Vorontsov dispatched his deputy, General Myshlayevsky, and Chief of Staff General Yudenich, along with other officers, to meet General Bergmann at Micingirt (now Inkaya). Bergmann argued that the Turkish attack on Istomins detachment was of local significance and that Istomin would retake Oltu once reinforced by the 3rd Caucasian Rifle Brigade. He also suggested that the 39th Division should continue its offensive on the main front.

General Yudenich disagreed, arguing that the attack on Istomins detachment signalled a Turkish outflanking manoeuvre. He maintained that since the Ottomans were attempting to encircle the Russian right flank, it was critical to hold Bardz village to secure the road to Sarikamish, where the railway line passed. Yudenich believed it was unnecessary to launch further offensives and instead advocated for a defensive posture and reinforcement of Sarikamish.

General Myshlayevsky initially tried to incorporate both proposals into his orders, calling for an offensive to retake Oltu while simultaneously securing the roads to Sarikamish. However, at 11:30 a.m., he learned that Bardz had already been occupied by a strong Ottoman force. Consequently, he abandoned Bergmann's offensive objectives and adopted Yudenich's defensive strategy in his revised orders of the day.

On the night of 24 December, Enver Pasha and his headquarters staff including Bronsart Pasha, Feldmann Bey, and Colonel Guse (all German officers) reached Bardz village from Narman after a 14-hour journey on horseback. Enver proposed that IX Corps should immediately advance toward the Sarikamish railway, based on information from captured soldiers who claimed that Sarikamish was defended by only two to three improvised companies.

Enver asked IX Corps commander Ali Ihsan Pasha for his opinion. Ali Ihsan Pasha replied:

"... According to this situation (the 17th and 28th Divisions had not yet reached Bardz), it means that IX Corps currently has no forces at hand other than the 29th Division. I do not know the operational requirements concerning the army. It is said that there is no information from X Corps. If your aim can be realized with the strength of a single division tomorrow, the 29th Division is ready for action and command."

Bronsart Pasha and Major Feldmann agreed with Ihsan Pasha's assessment. After three days of marching, IX Corps required rest. Moreover, communication between IX and X Corps had been severed after X Corps deviated from the initial plan by pursuing Istomin's unit along the OltuArdahan road. Consequently, the commanders under Enver Pasha suggested waiting at Bardz until X Corps could reach its designated objective.

However, Enver Pasha believed that if Sarikamish where the railway line passed was captured, the Russian forces would have no escape route and would be forced to surrender.

On the morning of 25 December, the 29th Division set out toward Sarikamish, moving along a path covered by 30 cm of snow. The division reached Kzlkilise village, 8 kilometres northwest of Sarikamish, and prepared to bivouac there. Nevertheless, Enver Pasha ordered an immediate attack on Bardz Pass and then on Sarikamish beyond it.

On the evening of 25 December, two regiments of the 29th Division, under Enver Pasha's orders, entered the forest to encircle the Russian troops defending Bardz Pass. Hundreds of soldiers froze to death in the forest, which was filled with ditches and cliffs, reducing the division's strength by 50 percent. Bardz Pass was captured from approximately 1,000 railway workers at around noon on 26 December. Only one battalion, too exhausted to continue effectively, was able to pursue the retreating Russian troops and was ultimately unsuccessful in attacking Sarikamish alone.

That night, the division's commander and officers avoided frostbite by covering themselves in oilcloths together, while the situation for the soldiers was even more severe.

Meanwhile, X Corps under Hafz Hakk pursued Istomin's brigade from 24 to 25 December. Istomin conducted a skillful delaying action, gradually retreating to Merdenek (now Gole) village. Eventually, the 30th and 31st Divisions of X Corps reached the northern slopes of the Allahuekber Mountains. Hafz Hakk left a regiment to contain Istomin's detachment and led the remaining forces into the Allahuekber Mountains in an attempt to cut the SarkamsKars railway line.

The Allahuekber crossing was rugged and snow-covered, and soldiers required at least 19 hours to traverse it. At 2:00 a.m. on 26 December, the 30th and 31st Divisions entered the mountains but were soon caught in a severe snowstorm. According to Serif Ilden, around 10,000 soldiers died from frostbite in the Allahuekber Mountains. When these two divisions emerged on the night of 26 December, their numbers had been reduced to 3,200. X Corps had thus lost approximately 90 percent of its strength before even engaging in a major battle.

Despite this, Hafz Hakk believed that stragglers could be gathered to bring his force back up to around 10,000 troops within two days, and he decided to continue the offensive.

On the morning of 26 December, the strength of the Sarikamish garrison increased from about 2,000 makeshift defenders to approximately 3,5004,000 soldiers. This included 1,500 regular troops, 1,000 railway workers, and 1,000 militia, along with several hundred rear-service volunteers. On this same day, Muratoff claimed that IX Corps still had 10,000 soldiers; however, Serif Ilden, chief of staff of IX Corps, stated that after the night attack on 25 December, only a force equivalent to one regiment about 3,000 soldiers remained. Only the 29th Division (nine battalions) and four battalions from the 17th Division managed to participate in the attack on 26 December. The battalions of the 17th Division numbered about 300 men each (1,200 total), while the 29th Division had about 1,800 soldiers (approximately 200 per battalion).

These figures aligned with an interview given by Ali Ihsan Pasha (commander of IX Corps at the time) to a Russian newspaper after his capture, where he stated that he had only 6,000 soldiers remaining from an initial strength of 28,000. The 22,000 losses were due to desertion, frostbite, and disease.

On 26 December, Turkish forces launched a determined offensive that continued until evening. Turkish commanders eventually convinced Enver Pasha to stop the attack, which had been pushed forward on his insistence. Russian sources claimed that if the offensive had continued, Sarikamish might have fallen. In contrast, Turkish sources argued that the army suffered severe losses as a result of Enver Pasha's reckless "attack without regard for casualties" orders and that the Turkish forces were outnumbered, exhausted, and ill-prepared.

That night, General Voropanov, commander of the Sarikamish garrison, requested permission from General Myshlayevsky to destroy the warehouses and abandon Sarikamish, citing heavy casualties. Myshlayevsky insisted that Sarikamish must be held at all costs, as the SarikamishKars railway was the only viable route for a Russian withdrawal. Both Myshlayevsky and General Bergmann had already been panicked by the Turkish encirclement attempts and had begun to consider defeat inevitable.

Meanwhile, five Turkestan battalions under Yudenich attacked Bardz, defeating the 82nd Regiment of the 28th Division with a bayonet charge. Observing this, the 32nd Division commander, Lieutenant Colonel Abdulkerim Bey, abandoned plans to move toward Sarikamish and engaged the Turkestan battalions instead.

On the evening of 26 December, Sarikamish received reinforcements: the 80th Kabardinsky Regiment (four battalions, each about 1,000 men) and the Zaporojski Cossack Regiment (six cavalry squadrons). With these reinforcements, the Russian force at Sarikamish rose to about 10,000 soldiers, albeit with limited artillery support.

On the Turkish side, efforts to reassemble dispersed deserters continued. By the afternoon of 26 December, the 83rd and 84th Regiments of the 28th Division arrived, but these units had also been severely depleted by forced night marches. Turkish sources do not record exact troop numbers, but it is estimated there were no more than 5,000 soldiers present on 27 December.

Enver Pasha renewed his "attack without regard for casualties" order for 27 December. The 29th Division managed to enter Upper Sarikamish village (known in Turkish sources as Cerkezkoy) at midday, but Colonel Bukretov counterattacked and encircled the Turkish forces in the village.

Meanwhile, on 27 December, Hafz Hakk Bey sent a cavalry regiment to occupy Selim station, where they destroyed part of the SarikamishKars railway. Stange Bey, commanding an infantry regiment and Special Organization irregulars, captured Ardahan, defended by three battalions of the 3rd Plastun Brigade (about 2,000 soldiers).

On 24 December, Nasuhi Bey, chief of staff of X Corps, was captured. A copy of Enver Pashas attack order was found on him, revealing to Russian commanders that IX and X Corps were both advancing on Sarikamish. General Myshlayevsky, believing he could not repel two corps with his weakened forces, feared total destruction. However, he was unaware that Turkish troop numbers had already been reduced by 80% due to attrition and desertion.

On 28 December, shaken by news of Ardahans fall and the railways destruction, Myshlayevsky left Mecingirt for Kagzman and then Tbilisi without appointing a new overall commander. Yudenich assumed command of the 2nd Turkestan Corps and six battalions of the 1st Caucasian Corps, while the remaining troops were commanded by Bergmann. Disputes between Bergmann and Yudenich arose over this arrangement, ultimately leading to Bergmann's dismissal after the battle and Yudenich's appointment as overall commander of what was formally named the Sarikamish Group.

The 30th and 31st Divisions only reached Sarikamish from BaskoyBeykoy on 29 December, delaying the plan to encircle Russian forces coming from Kars.

The Russian plan was to remain defensive against XI Corps, redeploy forces from that front to Sarikamish, and hold Sarikamish at all costs.

On 28 December, the 155th Kubinski Regiment (four battalions) and the 1st Plastun Brigade (five battalions) arrived at Sarikamish. The Russian force now comprised 20 infantry battalions, one cavalry regiment, 34 artillery pieces, and numerous machine guns under the 1st Plastun Brigade commander, General Przevalski. Muratoff estimated their total strength at 13,00014,000 soldiers.

As IX Corps fell to about 1,000 soldiers, the 30th and 31st Divisions took over the main assault on Sarikamish. These divisions were also reduced to around 2,000 men. On the night of 29 December, the 93rd Regiment of the 31st Division briefly entered Sarikamish with 600 men but had to retreat under heavy counterattacks. Turkish forces occupying barracks in the town were captured the following morning.

On 30 December, Russians brought six mortars from Mecingirt and bombarded Turkish positions. After a fierce three-day siege, the Turks defending Upper Sarikamish surrendered. Russian sources claimed 300 surrendered, while Turkish sources reported only 20.

By 30 December, the 32nd Division and 82nd Regiment initially 7,000 strong had dwindled to 500 soldiers due to frostbite and desertion.

On 31 December, Enver Pasha unexpectedly ordered a general attack by X Corps. Though initially successful in penetrating the first Russian lines, the attack ultimately failed under heavy fire. By 1 January, IX Corps was reduced to 900 soldiers, most of them wounded and frostbitten. The 17th Division's machine gun company fought until the last man, and its weapons were recovered by a rear guard unit.

At this point, Enver Pasha was urged to withdraw to avoid personal capture, but he refused, declaring that he would die with his soldiers. Eventually, his trusted chief of staff, Serif Ilden, convinced him that the only remaining hope was to employ XI Corps to extract IX and X Corps.

On 31 December, Yudenich convinced Bergmann who was still considering withdrawal to move his forces to Sarikamish and begin a decisive encirclement. Russian forces concentrated 7 battalions from Kars, 4 battalions of the 2nd Plastun Brigade, and 14 Cossack sotni (100 cavalry each) to surround IX and X Corps, which by then had shrunk to around 3,000 soldiers.

On 31 December, the arrival of the 154th Derbenski Regiment increased Russian active strength to about 7,000.

Colonel Bukretov, with six battalions from General Przevalski, attacked Bardz Pass. Turkish defenders fell from 700 soldiers on 31 December to 150 by 2 January. After this, Bukretov's force was also reduced to only 800 effective soldiers. On 2 January, Colonel Maslannikov, having replaced Bukretov, captured Bardz Pass with additional reinforcements.

By 3 January, IX Corps was completely surrounded, reduced to 104 soldiers and 106 officers after three days of attacks. X Corps had declined to 1,0001,200 soldiers and successfully repelled attacks from 13 January.

On 2 January, Enver Pasha visited Divik to inspect X Corps and ordered the consolidation of IX and X Corps into a single command, the Left Flank Army, under Hafz Hakk Bey, whom he promoted to brigadier general. Despite Hafz Hakk's disastrous decision to cross the Allahuekber Mountains, Enver trusted him as a classmate from the War College. Hafz Hakk Pasha was appointed commander of the 3rd Army five days later.

On 3 January, Sarikamish was overwhelmed with 12,000 sick and wounded Russians and 3,000 Turkish prisoners. General Bergmann ordered the transport of these men to Kars. Believing the congestion signaled a Russian evacuation, Hafz Hakk delayed withdrawal, which proved a costly error.

On 4 January, Russian forces launched a general offensive. After putting up fierce resistance, IX Corps finally surrendered with 80 soldiers and 106 officers. At the time, Hafz Hakk Pasha was meeting with IX Corps officers and narrowly escaped capture by mounting his horse and riding to X Corps under heavy fire.

X Corps managed to increase its strength to 1,800 soldiers by gathering deserters. On 4 January, despite being attacked by forces from Sarikamish in addition to General Baratov's detachment, X Corps was able to resist, even though its right flank was broken, avoiding the total collapse suffered by IX Corps. Hafz Hakk Pasha withdrew X Corps during the night of 45 January. Despite being pursued by Russian forces, he managed to save all the corps' equipment and reached Bardz on 6 January. At that point, the 30th and 31st Divisions had a combined strength of approximately 2,500 rifles and 16 cannons.

Enver Pasha left X Corps on the morning of 4 January. On the way, the army headquarters was attacked by 810 Cossack cavalry, who were dispersed by return fire. During this skirmish, Bronsart Pasha, Enver's chief of staff, was wounded in the arm, and a telegraph officer was wounded in the foot. Enver Pasha reached Bardz around noon, which was held by the 32nd Division.

Enver ordered the 32nd Division to unite with XI Corps to attack the Russians in order to relieve IX Corps (unaware that it had already surrendered) and the retreating X Corps. Due to heavy fog on 4 January, the 32nd Division could not attack. In his report, Colonel Abdulkerim Bey, commander of the 32nd Division, stated that the strength of his division had increased from 500 to 4,300 soldiers after regrouping. This highlights that many of the casualties during the Sarikamish operation were actually due to desertion.

Abdulkerim Bey began his offensive on 5 January. However, after two days of fighting, the strength of the 32nd Division was reduced again to 1,500 soldiers by 6 January. The infantry regiment left by X Corps to face General Istomin on 26 December had also decreased to 2,000 soldiers. From an initial combined strength of 68,000 in IX and X Corps, fewer than 10,000 soldiers remained.

In a report dated 5 January, Galip Pasha, commander of XI Corps, requested two additional days to recover from the corps' losses before launching an attack. Despite this, Enver Pasha insisted on an immediate offensive, which began on 6 January but achieved no significant success apart from pushing back Russian forces slightly. On this day, Enver received a report from Hafz Hakk Pasha confirming that IX Corps had been destroyed and the remnants of X Corps had gathered at Bardz.

Serif Ilden, chief of staff of IX Corps during the campaign, wrote in his memoirs that the battle might have been won by the Ottoman forces if Enver Pasha and Hafz Hakk Pasha had not weakened the army by ordering forced marches on 2526 December, which caused an estimated 80% loss of strength. Nikolski, who noted that the Russians had won "with great difficulty" after nine days of continuous fighting, also supported Ilden's view. Nevertheless, these poor decisions led to a complete disaster for the Ottoman forces.

Fearing that the front might collapse under a potential Russian counterattack, on 5 January Enver Pasha ordered the V Corps of the 1st Army, which was stationed around Skutari, to move rapidly to the Caucasus to reinforce the Third Army. However, Liman von Sanders, then commander of the 1st Army, wanted to keep this corps to defend Constantinople against a possible British-Russian attack. With the support of the German Embassy, he successfully prevented the V Corps from being redeployed.

Since the last hope of success had ended, and Enver Pasha was not permitted to stay away from Istanbul permanently, he left the army with his entourage on 9 January. Hafz Hakk Bey (later known as Hafz Hakk Pasha) was appointed commander of the Third Army and promoted to pasha (brigadier general).

General Yudenich subsequently sent 34 battalionsconsisting of the 1st and 2nd Plastun Brigades (12 battalions), the 3rd Caucasian Rifle Brigade (8 battalions), and the 20th Infantry Division (14 battalions)to Crimea to support the European front. (Muratoff wrote 43 battalions, which appears to be a typographical error.) After these transfers, the Russians rapidly mobilized about 100,000 reservists, formed an additional 17 battalions, and replenished existing units that had been depleted during the winter campaign. By the summer of 1915, the Russian Caucasus Army numbered approximately 130,000 infantry, 35,000 cavalry, and 340 guns. In comparison, the Ottoman forces in the region had about 52,351 soldiers and 131 cannons. Despite this, the Ottomans defeated the Russians in battles later that summer.

Although X Corps had managed to escape Russian encirclement, the Third Armywhose strength did not exceed 20,000 soldiers (the XI Corps had 10,000 rifles on 8 January after receiving 5,000 reinforcements from the Erzurum Garrison) was pursued and attacked on all fronts. Due to the army's reduced numbers and the soldiers exhaustion, defeats occurred in various parts of the front, and many prisoners were captured. The detachment on the Oltu-Merdenek road was attacked by General Kalitins force, consisting of 18 Cossack sotnias, 3 battalions of the 3rd Plastun Brigade, 2 battalions of the 263rd Regiment, and the Caucasian Cossack Division. Oltu, which had been captured by the Ottomans on 23 December, was recaptured by the Russians on 13 January, three weeks later. X Corps, attacked in the center, retreated from Bardz to Narman, while XI Corps retreated to east of Azap. From 19 January, the Russian offensive ceased, and relative calm settled on the front until April.

Russian casualties were estimated at up to 30,000: about 16,000 killed or wounded, and 12,000 sick or frostbitten. Ottoman losses, as reported by Hafz Hakk Pasha and German Lieutenant Colonel Guse, were recorded at lower numbers: Hafz Hakk Pasha estimated 30,000 deaths, while Guse gave two figures11,000 deaths with 3,500 prisoners, and alternatively, 30,000 deaths with 27,000 prisoners.

Fevzi Cakmak, who served as Chief of the General Staff of Turkey between 1921 and 1944, claimed that total Ottoman casualties were 60,000 out of 118,000 men by 14 February 1915. According to his estimate, there were 23,000 buried in Russian territory, 7,000 captured, an estimated 10,000 dead in Ottoman territory, 10,000 killed over one month, and 10,000 who died in hospitals. This estimation was based on the difference between the army's strength before the battle (118,000) and its strength on 14 February (42,000) according to Ottoman documents.

However, this estimate contradicts some Turkish sources, as it omits the large number of deserters and approximately 20,000 reinforcements hastily sent to the front, (Fevzi Cakmak mentions only 6,000 reinforcements, which appears inaccurate).

Casualties during the winter campaign were largely due not to combat in the first days, but to frostbite and the spread of epidemic diseases in the following weeks. Hunger and fatigueresulting from inadequate food supplies due to snow-blocked roadsfurther increased deaths from disease. A table published by the Turkish General Staff was used to inform the public about losses. Based on this table and simple calculations, it was suggested that total Ottoman losses in the Battle of Sarikamish were 109,108, though this figure omits deserters who were later regrouped. After gathering deserters and new recruits, the army's strength rose to 42,000 by 14 February.

Memoirs and reports from Turkish officers and commanders suggest total casualties were around 80,000: approximately 30,000 killed or wounded, 25,000 dead from cold, 20,000 who died in hospitals (mostly from epidemic typhus), and 7,000 taken prisoner.
