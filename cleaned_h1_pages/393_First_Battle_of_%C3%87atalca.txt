The First Battle of Catalca was one of the heaviest battles of the First Balkan War fought between 17 and 18 November 1912. It was initiated as an attempt of the combined Bulgarian First and Third armies, under the overall command of lieutenant general Radko Dimitriev, to defeat the Ottoman Army stationed in Catalca and break through the last Turkish defensive line before the capital Constantinople. The high casualties however forced the Bulgarians to call off the attack.
