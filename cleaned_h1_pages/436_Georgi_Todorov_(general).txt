Georgi Stoyanov Todorov (Bulgarian: ) (born on 10 August 1858 in Bolgrad; died on 16 November 1934 in Sofia) was a Bulgarian general who fought in the Russo-Turkish War (18771878), Serbo-Bulgarian War (1885), Balkan Wars (19121913) and First World War (19141918).

At the age of 19, he volunteered in the Bulgarian Corps (Opalchentsi) during the Russo-Turkish Liberation War. After the liberation, he graduated the first course of the Military School in Sofia (1879). In 1882, he entered the Sankt Peterburg Academy but could not graduate it because he returned for the Unification of Bulgaria in 1885 and took part in the war that followed immediately after it. During the war against Serbia, he commanded a unit which fought successfully against the enemy in the area of Vidin and Kula.

After the war, he participated in the dethroning of Alexander I and was dismissed from the Army in 1886. Only a year later, he returned to office. On 13 August 1887, he was promoted to major. On 1 January 1896, Todorov became a colonel. He served in the Military School and as a chief of the Sevlievo garrison. On 1 January 1910 he was promoted major general and a commander of the Seventh Rila Infantry Division.

During the First Balkan War (19121913) as a commander of the Seventh Rila Infantry Division, he advanced towards Solun and on 26 January 1913 he defeated the Ottomans in the Battle of Bulair.

During the Second Balkan War (1913), he and his division participated in the Battle of Kalimantsi where the Serbs were defeated.

After the accession of Bulgaria in the First World War, he commanded the 2nd Army. He led the operations in Macedonia which ended with the defeat of the Serbs in the Battle of Ovche Pole. With that success, the Bulgarians did not allow the meeting of the Serbian Army and the Anglo-French forces who embarked in Solun. In February 1917, he was in command of the 3rd Army and defeated the Romanians in Dobrudzha. From 8 September 1918, he became commander-in-chief of the Bulgarian Army after the illness of General Nikola Zhekov.
