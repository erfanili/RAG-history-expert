What key assumption about Belgian neutrality underpinned Germany's 1914 Schlieffen Plan?", "answer": 
"A question that gets to the heart of World War I's complexities! \n\nThe Schlieffen Plan, devised by 
Alfred von Schlieffen, Chief of the Imperial German General Staff from 1891 to 1906, was a military strategy 
aimed at quickly defeating France and then turning to deal with Russia. The plan involved a two-stage invasion 
of France: first, Germany would attack through neutral Belgium, attempting to encircle and defeat the French armie
s; second, once France had been defeated, Germany would shift its focus to Russia.\n\nHowever, as you've noted, M
oltke the Younger adapted this plan in 1906, adding divisions to the left flank opposite the French frontier. T
his modification aimed to accommodate an attack in the centre or an enveloping attack from both flanks. The ma
in German force would still advance through Belgium and attack southwards into France.\n\nRegarding the Briti
sh response, it's true that the UK did not initially declare war on Germany when the invasion of Belgium occu
rred. Instead, Britain waited until August 4, 1914, to declare war after Germany's violation of Belgian neutr
ality.\n\nThe Agadir Crisis in 1911, which involved German and British naval forces, likely contributed to Br
itish suspicions about German intentions towards Belgium. The panic-stricken Wilhelm II's attempts to redirec
t the main attack against Russia also highlight the complexities of German decision-making during this perio
d.\n\nAs for Charles Magnette's proposal for a humanitarian agreement between warring parties, it was a nob
le effort, but ultimately unsuccessful in halting the atrocities committed by the German army in Belgium.\
n\nIn summary, the Schlieffen Plan evolved over time, with Moltke the Younger making adjustments to accom
modate different scenarios. The British response was influenced by the Agadir Crisis and concerns about 
German intentions towards Belgium."tag":
